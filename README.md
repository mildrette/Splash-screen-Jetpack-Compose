# Splash Screen or Welcome screen of an app

A splash screen is the first screen that appears when you open an app 
usually displaying the app logo, name, or branding 
while the app is loading or initializing in the background.

### Purpose of a Splash Screen

### Branding:
Shows your logo or app name to make a good first impression.

### Loading Time Masking:
Covers up short delays while your app is setting up resources.

### Smooth Launch Transition:
Makes the startup feel professional and seamless instead of showing a blank or flickering screen.
